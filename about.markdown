## Code of Conduct

### Short Version

We try to handle moderation ASAP, but we may not see reports for several hours. We will get to all reports though!

We're not a free speech absolutist, and there are instances available for that. We're not interested in Nazis, TERFS, or hate speech of any sort, which we will define at our sole discretion as moderators. No homophobia, transphobia, queerphobia, racism allowed.

This instance is meant to be a friendly, welcoming space to all who are willing to reciprocate in helping to create that environment.

    the right to revoke any user's access permissions, at any time, for any
    reason, except as limited by law.

### Content Warnings and Sensitive Media

Our Content Warning (CW) policy is intended to make our server comfortable for our community. We are not trying to silence our community or police discussion, but ask that you consider those who may read your posts when making them.

Content Warnings are a feature of Mastodon that enable you to hide the body of a "toot" (post) behind a line of text. The intended use of this feature is to provide a way to discuss sensitive and/or potentially harmful topics without causing duress or harm to anyone who might stumble upon it, though content warnings may be used for a wide variety of reasons.

Images can be marked as sensitive. This is a feature which hides an image until a warning banner is clicked. Images may be marked as sensitive separately from Content Warnings, though using a Content Warning automatically marks the toot's images as sensitive.

Please note that our sensitive media rules apply to profile photos and headers as well. Since those images cannot be hidden behind sensitive media warnings, they are not allowed to contain content from enforced content warnings.

We cannot enforce content warnings on users from other instances, but can help to manage content that you see when reported to instance moderators.

Please be clear and accurate when labeling content warnings, to ensure that they follow both the letter and spirit of the enforcements that we have.

**Above all, try to be polite, and come from a place of mutual respect when discussing content warnings with other. We do not condone tone policing, and want to promote healthy discussion in our community.**

This cannot ever be a complete list, and so we want to keep it semi-general, and reserve the right to use the judgement of the moderation team to make decisions in the future.

- Enforced Content Warnings:
    - NSFW/sexual discussion and imagery must be behind descriptive CWs (nudity, sex, kink discussion, etc)
    - Sensitive imagery (please use your best judgement on what content that most other users would find sensitive, such as photos of surgeries, abuse, war, deceased individuals, etc)
- Suggested Content Warnings:
    - Discussion of overtly political (relating to elected or unelected government officials) topics
    - Triggering topics (direct discussion of rape, trauma, abuse, suicide, transphobia, homophobia, etc). The intention is to provide a warning for users who may not want to consume this content, not to silence users who are sharing their negative experiences.
    - Drugs or drug use
    - Advertisements for corporations
    - "Rage" posts and posts using mainly capital letters
- Suggested Sensitive Image Marking
    - Eye contact images
    - Food related images

### CryptoCurrency/NFTs

We do not allow the promotion, advertisement, or sale of cryptocurrencies on our instance. Mentioning the existence of cryptocurrencies, linking personal accounts or addresses, and otherwise discussing them in a way that is not intended to sell or advertise a specific cryptocurrency is acceptable. We do not have any association with any cryptocurrency or other monetary transactions that happen within the server.

We do not allow the promotion, advertisement, or sale of NFTs on our instance. We do not allow content from our instance, including content and media uploaded by our community members, to be sold as NFTs.

## Blocked Instances

We maintain a blocklist of instances that we do not federate with. If you believe that an instance should be added to this list, please contact an admin or moderator.

**For privacy and safety of our community, we do not comment on most instance blocks that we have in place. We have recently begun sharing details on major/oft commented moderation decisions via [@mods@tech.lgbt](https://tech.lgbt/@mods)**

The list is visible for logged-in members under the section **Moderated servers** on [https://tech.lgbt/about](https://tech.lgbt/about). While we understand that not publishing this list for non-members is not fully transparent, we are not trying to scare of potential new members who want to ensure that their friends are not blocked. The only nefarious intent here are those who have used this information when public to harass individuals and the instance as a whole. Bluntly, if those are the people that you want to interact with, you should probably join their instance instead.
