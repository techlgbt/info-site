Only in case of breach of applicable law, or if instance rules have been seriously breached (Certain rules clearly need to be applied more leniently in these cases, such as rules protecting private conversations.

There should be an appeal process for any limit/suspension as well. An appeal process allows for an individual or instance to fix/improve and rejoin the community. It also allows a chance for ""sorry I didn't realize blank, I will do better in future"". When considering what to post transparency wise in the case of violence/threats, its always good to consider what that will entail for the victim as well as the person limited/suspended. As sad as it is, some people are intentionally trying to get suspended/banned as many places as possible, almost like a badge of honor.

Most systems have both serverside and as client features ignore lists for accounts and instances on an individual basis. There is little need for instance admins to interfere with user's decisions (not) to block someone. There may be a point in preventing ban evasion by shielding users who blocked someone from a new account when the identity is clearly the same. On the other hand doing so proactive may be a burden for the admins and there should be better spam filter like systems in the hands of users. It is important to respect the autonomy of users because things like instance blocks create catch 22 situations when, for example, choosing an instance and either having to choose one who blocks A for reasons you may not agree with (or even without known reasons) or B, but without an option to have an instance that blocks neither. In general many Fediverse instances err on the side of overblocking what is unfortunate for new users.","I use centralized social media (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc),I use decentralized social media (Mastodon, Misskey, Pleroma, Lemmy, etc)",

• Generally moderation transparency is recommended promptly if the local and near associated community requests so
• Moderation service is to the benefit of the local instance first, the desires of the local community is prioritized over the desires of remote community
• Aggregate moderation decisions that sever remote relationships quarterly or even monthly often are irrelevant, if an instance suspension or limit occurs, and assuming the moderation team will disclose the reasoning/decisions publicly at all, it should be done immediately. Late transparency reports do not help severed users reconnect if the report is published weeks/months later and any delay only adds more difficulty for users to reconnect

fae feels like defederation should avoided when possible when there are any relationships, especially involving local active users following remote users

(of course, that's not to say defederations cannot be done, but there should be a consensus among staff team, and the alternatives need to be considered)

if there is a decision to defederate a popular instance (as far tech.lgbt users are concerned), it definitely makes sense not only to announce the decision, explain the reasons, and give people time to migrate if they choose to

generally vagueness fae feels is to be avoided for defederations of popular instances, in particular because it makes other instances, and in particular the affected instance ask questions about what happened to know what to do (like what happened with nano.lgbt, for instance)

But I've now had one occasion where an instance was suspended and I was (mildly) affected, and having to rely purely on trust in the moderation team that the suspension was a reasonable course of action was rather unpleasant. So I don't think a 99% non-disclosure policy of moderation actions is the way to go. If a small group of people can in theory radically change how I experience the fediverse, I want them to have some degree of (collective) accountability, even if I personally trust them. Without more transparency, such accountability can't really exist.","I use decentralized social media (Mastodon, Misskey, Pleroma, Lemmy, etc)",
