# Tech.LGBT Moderation Guidelines

## Moderation Principles

Our guiding value for moderation, above all else, is the protection of our members. We are a community of marginalized individuals with a diversity of life experiences, and we respect the trust that our members put in us as moderators.

With that trust we have responsibility, and this document is an attempt to outline this responsibility. No document can cover all moderation events that may come up, but the general rules that guide our moderation team are:

- Moderation will be proactive where possible. If we can take the onus off of our members in blocking harmful servers (instances), we will do so.
- Moderation will be as transparent as reasonable.
    - Preserving the privacy of members
    - Avoiding pile-ons

## Moderator Conduct

Moderators are here to protect our community and make this a welcoming space to our users.

We do this by keeping a watch of the local and federated feeds, responding to user reports, and managing users accounts on our server (most commonly reviewing account applications).

Moderators should refrain from discussing details about ongoing issues/reports except in the case of serious large scale problems that justify public attention (usually via #Fediblock / #InstanceBlock). Additionally, specific details that can be used to identify parties involve should also be kept private only to the moderation team and affected users on a need-to-know basis. (We highly value our users’ personal data and uphold privacy as a core tenant of administration.) Breaking this rule on privacy can result in revocation of moderator/administrator status and/or suspension of their account.

## Moderator Communication

Clear communication between our staff and others is vital to making appropriate decisions and maintaining healthy relationships with the wider Fediverse.

Our moderation team will issue statements via our moderator account, @mods@tech.lgbt. Our moderators are allowed to express their own opinions via their own profiles, but personal account posts do not represent the moderation team or server as a whole.

Communication between another server’s moderation staff and ours should be done through the email, mods@tech.lgbt, or through direct messaging on the mods@tech.lgbt account. For these communications, this should be done as the collective voice of the moderation staff and thus should be discussed as a group before communicating with other teams.

## Account Approvals

Our primary goal in account reviews before accessing the server/instance is to keep out bots and corporate accounts.  Accounts with minimal or no reasoning in their submissions will be denied with prejudice. Accounts that aim to make their presence in the Fediverse by using our service solely for hosting a business will also be denied approval.

- We accept people, not proxies of people.

We also will not approve accounts that state in their submissions that they support ideals that directly or indirectly oppose our core tenants (i.e. to promote religious rhetoric; to debate against LGBTQIA+ communities).

## Reports and Appeals

All user reports should be actioned with confidence.

If a report is easily determined to have broken our rules, the moderator should action it accordingly.

If a report appears to be more nuanced, then the moderator should investigate deeper to determine the context of the post and of the report itself to determine if any violation has occurred. Simple debates in which one party just disagrees with the other and felt the need to report is not actionable unless it meets the criteria for violation of our rules.

Reports that involve other languages should be run through translators or brought up to staff that are fluent in the language so proper understanding of the report can be attained.

In the case that the action taken is appealed, the rest of the moderation team should be informed of the case in question and collectively decide if the action taken was justified (denying the appeal), or if the user receiving the action taken on them has corrected their conduct to justify reversal of the decision or if the decision was made unjustly (approving the appeal).

Similarly, if there is a request to unlimit/revoke suspension of a server, the moderation team should collectively decide if the reason for taking action against a server was justified or is still justified. If the server in question is deemed to still be a threat, we should also be conscientious in replying to the request.
